# BatchHardSampler

This repository provides a sampler to construct uniform batches from a dataset consisting of multiple identities with multiple samples for each identity. In addition, it provides a function `select_triplets` which - given a batch of embeddings - selects triplets according to the *batch hard* strategy (https://omoindrot.github.io/triplet-loss#batch-hard-strategy).
